# Intel IoT Examples Datastore

## Introduction

The Intel IoT Example Datastore is intended to provide a simple data store for sample applications that are part of the how-to Intel IoT code samples.

It is a Node.js* application written using [Express][]. It uses a [Redis][] data store.

Although this data storage application is initially developed to deploy on Microsoft* Azure* since it is based on commonly used open-source modules, it should be easy to deploy on many different cloud hosts.

[Redis]: http://redis.io/

## How it works

The Intel IoT Examples Datastore application provides a simple REST API that allows authorized callers to store either log data or incremental counter data.

It exposes two sets of routes, both using basic token authentication.

To authorize, provide the AUTH_TOKEN you set in the `X-Auth-Token` HTTP header.

Multiple clients can share the same Intel IoT Examples Datastore by simply using a different route key for each application.

### Counter

The counter routes are used to increment an increasing counter.

- **GET /counter/:key** - gets the current value of a counter
- **GET /counter/:key/inc** - increments a counter by 1

### Logger

The logger routes wrap Redis* lists, and are used to keep a linear backlog of values.

- **GET /logger/:key** - gets the latest value of a log
- **PUT /logger/:key** - adds a value to a log (`value` param in POST body)
- **GET /logger/:key/all** - returns all values of a log

## Local setup

To install the application dependencies, use the following command:

    $ npm install

You'll also need to have Redis* installed.
For more information, see the [Redis* download page](http://redis.io/download).

## Configuration

Primary configuration for the application takes the form of the following `ENV` variables:

- `REDIS_URL` - the URL to use for Redis* communication
- `REDIS_AUTH` - authentication token for the Redis* backend
- `PORT` - port to serve the application on (defaults to `3000`)
- `AUTH_TOKEN` - authentication token for clients to use

## Deployment  - Microsoft* Azure*

This guide covers setting up a deployment environment for the Intel IoT Datastore on Microsoft* Azure*.

For other platforms, refer to the platform documentation.

Before we begin, ensure you have a [Microsoft* Azure* account](https://portal.azure.com/signin/index).

### Create a new web application

![Settings](images/new-web-app.png)

1. Click **New** and select **Web + Mobile > Web App**.
2. Enter the name for your new web application.
3. Click **Create**.<br>
Your new web application is created.

### Create a new Redis* cache

![Settings](images/new-redis-cache.png)

1. Click **New** and select **Data + Storage > Redis Cache**.
2. Enter the name for your new Redis* cache.
3. Click **Create**.<br>
Your new Redis* cache is created.

### Determine settings for Redis*

![Settings](images/redis-list.png)

1. In the left sidebar, select **Redis Caches** and click the name of the new Redis* cache you created in the previous step.<br>

2. Select **All settings > Properties**.
3. Write down or copy the value in the **HOST NAME** field so you can use it for the `REDIS_URL` setting for the web application.<br>

4. Select **All settings > Access keys**. 
5. Write down or copy the value in the **PRIMARY** or **SECONDARY** field so you can use it for the `REDIS_AUTH` setting for the web application.<br>

6. Select **All settings > Access Ports**.
7. Set the **Allow access only via SSL** option to **No**.
8. Click **Save**.

### Configure the web application

![Settings](images/web-list.png)

1. In the left sidebar, select **Web Apps** and click the name of the new web application you previously created.<br>
![Settings](images/web-app-settings.png)

2. Select **All settings > Application settings**.
3. Scroll down to the **App settings** section.
4. Specify `REDIS_URL` by typing the value from the **HOST NAME** field above.
5. Specify `REDIS_AUTH` by typing the value from the **PRIMARY** field above.
6. Specify `AUTH_TOKEN` by typing whatever shared secret key you want.
7. Click **Save**.

Note: you don't need to set `PORT`, as the Microsoft* Azure* platform does that automatically.

### Deploy the web application

![Settings](images/new-deploy-credentials.png)

1. In the left sidebar, select **Web Apps** and click the name of the new web application you previously created.
2. Select **All settings > Continuous Deployment**.
3. Select **Choose Source > Local Git Repository**.
4. Click **Save**.
5. Select **All settings > Deployment credentials**.
6. Specify **FTP/deployment user name** and **Password**.
7. Click **Save**.
8. Select **All settings > Properties**.
9. Scroll down to the **Git URL** field and copy its contents.
10. In the directory you're using for this repository, use the command line to run the following Git* command that adds a Microsoft* Azure* server for deployment:

    git remote add azure <GitURL>

where `<gitURL>` is the value you obtained from the **Git URL** field on the **Properties** page.

Now you are ready to deploy the application. Run the following Git* command:

    git push azure master

You are prompted for the password you entered under **Deployment credentials**.

You should see output that ends like this:

    ...
    remote: Finished successfully.
    remote: Deployment successful.
    To https://username@my-intel-iot.scm.azurewebsites.net:443/my-intel-iot.git
      * [new branch]      master -> master

This means your application has been deployed to the Microsoft* Azure* cloud.
